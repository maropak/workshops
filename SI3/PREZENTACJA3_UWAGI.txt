From Slide 7 I see that you operates only on maps. 
I guess you should give here few slides telling how earlier translator worked, and how it will work now. 
That now some protocol, map, modification on map, some protocol,
Earlier translations were done directly on native protocols – get Value, put Value
Also Benchamrking earlier and expected . And example form Fix to Map. Show pls some config
People will ask here about repeating groups for sure. Discuss it earlier with Marcin Smolski
